## Here's a brief overview of the Project Roadmap 

### Step 1: AWS S3 Integration
Loaded the Northwind dataset into AWS S3 Buckets,
Created roles and policies to ensure secure access and efficient data management.

### Step 2: Schema Creation in Snowflake
Designed and implemented the schema for the data in Snowflake, ensuring optimal organization and performance.
This step laid the foundation for structured and efficient data ingestion and analysis.

### Step 3: Data Ingestion with Snowpipe
Utilized Snowpipe, Snowflake's native data ingestion service, to set up a continuous, real-time data ingestion process With S3 Integration and as an External Stage Ensured that any updates or additions to the dataset were automatically through SQS Queues.
Achieved full automation, ensuring regular updates and a constantly up-to-date data pipeline.

### Step 4: Power BI Integration
Connected Power BI to the data stored in Snowflake, using the Import mode to load it for analysis and visualization.
Worked with clean, transformed data in Power BI for further processing.

### Step 5: Data Cleaning and Model Building
Performed data cleaning and transformation tasks with Power Query to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
Built a data model that facilitated efficient analysis and exploration.

### Step 6: Data Visualization
AND finally Created visualizations in Power BI with various Dax measures and Calculations,
The Data is categorized into four main areas:
Revenue patterns,
Product metrics,
Key customers,
and Freight Analysis.

Analytics techniques like ABC classification and RFM analysis, are applied to extract valuable insights.
